It is a complete image of a virtual machine, including its operating system, applications, and configuration. In addition to the AMIs provided by AWS, we can also customize AMIs according to the project\u0026rsquo;s intended use.\nAn AWS AMI can be used to quickly and easily deploy OS-like instances and applications across multiple virtual machines. AWS offers a number of available AMIs, including images for popular operating systems such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows Server and more. Users can also create their own AMI from a running virtual machine and store it for later reuse or sharing with others.\n1 AMI includes: root volumes, AMI usage rights are specified for which accounts are used, EBS volume mapping\n"

You can create an AWS Auto Scaling group within EC2 instances. You can specify a minimum number of EC2 instances in that group, and auto-scaling will maintain and guarantee the minimum number of EC2 instances.\nWe can also specify a maximum number of EC2 instances in each auto-scaling group so that AWS Auto Scaling ensures instances never exceed that maximum limit. You can also specify your desired auto-scaling and capacity policies for AWS Auto Scailing in Amazon EC2. Using scaling policies, AWS Auto Scaling can launch or terminate EC2 instances based on need.\nContent AMI LaunchTemplate Load Balancer Now we will go through the most basic concepts of Auto Scaling Group.\n"
